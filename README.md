# Introduction

Nearby locations in space often exhibit strong spatial relationships. Due to this, for spatial clusters to be meaninful, they are often required to be spatially contiguous. Similar spatial patterns can also emerge at distant locations in space as patches (not in proximity), which are referred to as repeated spatial clusters.

An ideal spatial clustering framework:
- Should form spatially contiguous clusters.
- Should identify repeated spatial clusters.
